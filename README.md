PSI here, I consider myself a researcher and volunteer. I write and publish papers on ideas and concepts that I think are useful 
and important. 

I do my very best to only convey useful and factually correct info, but I also try to cover both sides of issues, 
and with an unbiased eye cover the ethics and facts. 

All of my papers can be found in my repos, always freely available. As well, any references I give will be free to use
because I feel its wrong to paywall research. 

If you have any topics I should cover, concerns, or would like to share some of your stuff with me:
